          <p>I'm a project-driven and solutions-oriented full-stack developer with strong skills in React, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. My work leans toward full-stack and data-focused development. I hold a Bachelors of science in Computer Information Technology, where I learned Python, SQL, and Java, and expanded into front-end technologies like JavaScript, React, and CSS through self-study.
  
  This portfolio website you're viewing is one of my personal projectsâ€”built from the ground up with React and custom CSS. It reflects not only my technical abilities but also my eye for design, responsiveness, and user experience. I used modern practices such as routing with React Router, component reuse, and mobile responsiveness to create a seamless, polished site.
  
  <p>Professionally, I work as a Level 1 & 2 Help Desk Analyst at KWI, where I troubleshoot mobile POS systems, write custom MySQL queries for diagnostics, and collaborate with development teams using tools like JIRA and Confluence. I also leverage Python-based PowerShell scripts to automate mobile device configurations and streamline support processes.</p>
  
 <p> Another key project I built was a regression analysis tool for U.S. highway car accident data. It involved a Visual Basic GUI connected to a live SQL database, allowing users to view, input, and analyze data interactively.</p>
  
  <p>My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer or data engineer role where I can solve real-world problems, building useful systems, and continue to hone and sharpen my skillset.</p></p>
